# trackR
A music app developed during 2XB3 application of algorithms course. It samples songs from the One Million Song Dataset (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) and after listening to a song, finds similar songs based on your preferences. The more you listen the closer the app gets to your favourite tempo, song key, dynamic range, etc.
